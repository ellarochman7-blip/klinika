## Troubleshooting

**401 Error?**
- Check your API key is correct (starts with `AIzaSy...`)
- Make sure you copied the whole key
- Try generating a new key

**404 or Model Not Found?**
- The `gemini-2.5-flash-image` or `veo-3.0-generate-001` models might not be available in your region
- Video generation (`veo-3.0-generate-001`) is very new and may have limited availability
- Try static image generation first if video fails
- Check Google AI Studio for model availability in your region
- `veo-3.0-generate-001` is still in limited preview and may not be accessible to all accounts yet
- The model requires special access in some regions

**Still not working?**
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify you have internet connection
- Make sure localStorage is enabled in your browser
